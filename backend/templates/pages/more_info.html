<div id="info-section-1">
  <h2 class="my-h">More Info</h2>
  <p>
    This site is based off of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">Bechdel-Wallace Test</a>,
    created by <a href="https://dykestowatchoutfor.com/">Alison Bechdel</a> and Liz Wallace, and was made to show the lack
    of representation of women in film in comparison to cisgendered men. It's my hope that by increasing
    awareness of this discrepancy, we can better coordinate efforts towards reducing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, while the Bechdel Test is an extremely useful tool, it's important to acknowledge its limitations.
    The fact that a movie passes the Bechdel Test says nothing about the actual representation of female characters within the film.
    A movie can pass and still depict sexist stereotypes or underwritten characters.
    It also does nothing to account for the representation of other marginalized groups in the film industry, such as people of colour,
    as well as transgender and gender non-conforming characters and actors.
  </p>
  <p>
    To paraphrase Alison Bechdel, the test was invented to show just how low of a bar can be set and still have movies fail, and is meant
    as a way to measure overall trends across the movie industry as opposed to on an individual basis. It's important to remember that just because
    a movie passes or fails the test, it doesn't automatically make it a <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> movie. That question is a lot more subtle and requires
    a more in depth examination than any yes/no question can provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site in its current state is simply a proof of concept that I hope to expand on in the future. Future considerations include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integrating with IMDB APIs (https://imdb-api.com/API)</li>
    <li>Add support for user submissions and comments</li>
    <li>Curating all the data to get more accurate test results</li>
    <li>Adding more useful graph breakdowns</li>
    <li>Add the anti-bechdel test (the same questions except for men) to use as a reference point as I suspect at least 95% of movies would pass that</li>
    <li>Add support for other, more useful tests (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="my-h">Have a movie to add?</h2>
  <p>
    While there's currently no tool for submitting movies yourself (I'm working on it!), you can email me at evanjwaterman at gmail dot com
    with the following and I'll add it to the list:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The movie title</li>
    <li>Whether or not the movie passes each of the individual rules
      <ol>
        <li>It has at least two named women in it</li>
        <li>Who talk to each other</li>
        <li>About something other than a man</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Any special notes or considerations you have</li>
  </ul>
